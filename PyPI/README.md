WARNING: pip is being invoked by an old script wrapper. This will fail in a future version of pip.
Please see https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5599 for advice on fixing the underlying issue.
To avoid this problem you can invoke Python with '-m pip' instead of running pip directly.

! longer maintained. pip 21.0 will drop support for Python 3.5 in January 2021. pip 21.0 will remove support for this 
! functionality.
